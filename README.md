# 2024 NASA Champions

Welcome to the 2024 NASA Champions Cohort! This is a Cohort for research
teams using NASA Earthdata to learn open science practices and spend
time experimenting and planning what their analytical workflows with
NASA Earthdata look like in the Cloud. This is part of NASA Openscapes:
<https://nasa-openscapes.github.io>. Learn more about Openscapes and the
Champions Program: <https://openscapes.org>.

## Co-working times (optional)

Co-working sessions are where we work at the same time together.
Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up focused work
and get feedback, and sometimes this involves asking questions and
screensharing to learn and problem solve.

Coworking takes place in the weeks between Cohort Calls on alternating
Thursdays: May 11, 25, June 8. 10:00 - 11:30 am PT.
