# 2024 NASA Champions

Welcome to the 2024 NASA Champions Cohort! This is a Cohort for research
teams using NASA Earthdata to learn open science practices and spend
time experimenting and planning what their analytical workflows with
NASA Earthdata look like in the Cloud. This is part of NASA Openscapes:
<https://nasa-openscapes.github.io>. Learn more about Openscapes and the
Champions Program: <https://openscapes.org>.

## Cohort Agendas

We will meet as a Cohort via Zoom five times over two months for 1.5
hours each:

- **Dates:** April 3, 17, May 1, 15, 29
- **Times:** 10:00 - 11:30 am PT
- **Location:** remotely, via Zoom

Agendas are accessible to Cohort participants in our [Cohort Google Drive
Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15_riqbdEcz6luf74yovJy-oKxIiKkU8r?usp=sharing); they are also an archive of our live
google-docing. Please see <https://openscapes.github.io/series> to view blank
versions of the agendas.

**NASA Openscapes Mentors have iterated lessons each year. In 2024 Data Strategies for Cloud included "When to Cloud" and Coding Strategies for Cloud included parallelizing code. All previous lessons are linked from <https://openscapes.github.io/series>.**

Cohort Call Digests are posted as Discussions in this repo.

## Coworking times (optional)

Coworking sessions are where we work at the same time together. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up focused work
and get feedback, and sometimes this involves asking questions and screensharing to learn and problem solve.

Coworking takes place in the weeks between Cohort Calls on alternating
Thursdays following our second Cohort Call: April 25, May 9, 23. 10:00 - 11:30 am PT.

## Participating teams

Some brief information about participating teams. Please add any edits
directly (we’ll learn how in our GitHub Clinic!)
